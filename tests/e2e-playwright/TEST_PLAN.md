# RedisInsight E2E Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive E2E testing strategy for RedisInsight features.

> **📋 Rules**: Before implementing tests, read [`.ai/rules/e2e-testing.md`](../../.ai/rules/e2e-testing.md) for coding standards, patterns, and best practices.

## Overview

The test plan is organized by feature area. Tests are grouped for parallel execution:
- **main** - Default group for all tests that can run in parallel
- Additional groups can be added for tests requiring special conditions (app reinstall, auto-update, etc.)

## Test Status Legend
